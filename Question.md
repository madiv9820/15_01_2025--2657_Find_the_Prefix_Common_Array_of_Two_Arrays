You are given two **0-indexed** integer permutations `A` and `B` of length `n`.

A **prefix common array** of `A` and `B` is an array `C` such that `C[i]` is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the index `i` in both `A` and `B`.

Return *the **prefix common array** of* `A` *and* `B`.

A sequence of `n` integers is called a **permutation** if it contains all integers from `1` to `n` exactly once.

- ### Examples:
    - **Example 1:**
        ```
        Input: A = [1,3,2,4], B = [3,1,2,4]
        Output: [0,2,3,4]
        Explanation: At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
        At i = 1: 1 and 3 are common in A and B, so C[1] = 2.
        At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.
        At i = 3: 1, 2, 3, and 4 are common in A and B, so C[3] = 4.
        ```
    - **Example 2:**
        ```
        Input: A = [2,3,1], B = [3,1,2]
        Output: [0,1,3]
        Explanation: At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
        At i = 1: only 3 is common in A and B, so C[1] = 1.
        At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.
        ```

- ### Constraints:
    - `1 <= A.length == B.length == n <= 50`
    - `1 <= A[i], B[i] <= n`
    - `It is guaranteed that A and B are both a permutation of n integers.`
<hr>

- ### Hints:
    - Consider keeping a frequency array that stores the count of occurrences of each number till index i.
    - If a number occurred two times, it means it occurred in both A and B since theyâ€™re both permutations so add one to the answer.
